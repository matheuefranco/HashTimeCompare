# HashTime: Hash Table Performance Analysis

## Overview

This project demonstrates and analyzes the performance of hash table implementations in Java. The App.java file contains code that measures and compares time efficiency of different hash operations.

## Project Description

The application performs time analysis on hash table operations such as insertion, search, and deletion. It shows how hash tables can achieve near constant-time performance for these operations, and demonstrates the impact of different load factors and collision resolution strategies.

## Features

- Time measurement for hash table operations
- Performance comparison between hash tables and other data structures
- Analysis of collision handling mechanisms
- Visualization of time complexity through performance metrics

## How to Run

Compile and run the App.java file to see the performance analysis:

```bash
javac App.java
java App
```

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
